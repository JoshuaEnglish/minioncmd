Welcome to MinionCmd's documentation!
=====================================

MinionCmd is an extension to the builtin cmd.Cmd class that allows for a 
hierarchy of subprograms in your command line application.

REPLs for the subprograms can switch to other subprograms or go back to the
main application REPL.

Users can quit the entire program from any subprogram.
